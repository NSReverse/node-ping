# ICMP Ping Test Utility

### Purpose

This web application was created because I am unable to ping ICMPv6 endpoints for work. This is a common problem at my workplace and I needed to test for network connectivity often. Being on an IPv4-only network, it was hard to test in realtime for connectivity. Therefore, this project is to set out and solve that problem.

### Tools Used

This web application utilizes Express for serving the front-end, Node.JS and Socket.IO on the backend for realtime communication. The server itself is hosted by DigitalOcean.

### Live Tool

This tool is available for access at http://ping.nsreverse.net/
